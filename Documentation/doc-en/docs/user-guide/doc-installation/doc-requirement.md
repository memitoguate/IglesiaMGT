## Mode evasive and security
* Apache mod-evasive may make the CRM ineffective
* Apache mod-security has to be be turned off


## Optional : WebDAV
* WebDAV/CalDav and CardDav are assets for the connection to work like NextCloud ...
* The file "data" has to be fix to 755

The last point is useless for the operation but a true asset for the app
