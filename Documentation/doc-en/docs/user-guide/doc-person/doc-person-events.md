    - The above-mentioned steps are the same

3. Activate a document

    -  A document can be made active or inactive


##Notes

- One can now add participants to the events
- They can be add to a reminder
- an inactive event will not appear in the calendar and will be displayed only in the events list; therefore it is possible to prepare events ahead of time and activate them progressively.
