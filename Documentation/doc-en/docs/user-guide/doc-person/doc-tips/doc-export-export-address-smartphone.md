It could happen that when one clicks on an address they would want the address in `AppleMap` instead of `GoogleMap`, it may be useful :

- in Android : GoogleMap
- in iPhone  : AppleMap

To deal with the problem

1. Go to personal settings

Then set them as following:

* sMapExternalProvider : When one will want to see an address on a map on their smartphone they will be able to choose the type of map (Apple Maps, GoogleMaps, BingMaps).

The problem should now be solved.
