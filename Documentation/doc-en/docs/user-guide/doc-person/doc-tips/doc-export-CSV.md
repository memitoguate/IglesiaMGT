One can have coding and separator problems in the case of a CVS export. It could occur when exporting a dictionary, the SundaySchool classes or when one will export some data in table form.

**Excel** or **LibreOffice** for example, may have problems to open the exported document.

Resolve the problem:

1. Go to personal settings

Then set them as following:
