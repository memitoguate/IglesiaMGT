# <center><big>Group management & Ecclesia**CRM** </big></center>


A group manager can add or remove a member to a group and only for this group.

A group manager could be define in a global or a local way:

- Global : this manager can determine a membership in any group
- Local : this manager will only be able to administer the membership of a specific group

> Note : a group manager can add a member, who already exists in the CRM or a new one, in a group. A family can enroll itself in the CRM (see the "Self-register families" section)
