  This is a calendar flow, so it will be found in the calendar view. You have to fill in :

    - the name of the flow
    - the calendar (don't forget to share it with the other people using it, see the help on calendars in the user manual)
    - the date and time is not a problem

You validate and the event is created both in the calendar and in the event flow management view.

#### Builder mode ! [Screenshot](../../../img/plugins/eventworkflow/eventworkflow4.png)

Click on this button, if not already done, by default it is active.

It will allow you to build your event flow completely:
- title
- container
- sub-container by managing your volunteer opportunities.

In each event flow, you can create a container, it can contain :

##### We can create a basic title

This is a trick to simulate titles

##### We can then create a sub-container

We transform this title into a block of containers of volunteer opportunities.

Here is the resulting view

- You can choose the volunteer opportunities
- the time (this is a guideline between two sub-containers)
- the objective: the number of volunteers to be reached

##### You can then add as many sub-containers as you want:

- sub-containers (doodles on the right, you can put as many as you want).
  The doodles :
