## Prerequisites

- The event flow manager is a plugin in Ecclesia**CRM** version 8.0.
- it requires a **calendar** (personal, group, material or shared), see the user manual and the calendar section.
- only a user with the right to use the plugin can use it.
- the notion of event flow is built on the volunteer opportunities (example below : Home, Leader etc ...)
  See for that the associated section : volunteer opportunities.

## Presentation
