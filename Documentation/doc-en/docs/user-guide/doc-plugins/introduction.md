With version 8.0.0, plugin management is now available. They will allow you to extend the management of EcclesiaCRM, making it an even more polymorphic and powerful tool.


# Introduction
It is possible for a developer to add the functionality he is missing:

- the management of videoconferences via Jitsi is now done via a plugin
- it is possible by contacting the EcclesiaCRM team to manage event flows, see the documentation for that
- other plugins will be released later.

# Management

- Plugins can be activated/deactivated and deleted.
- a plugin is built on strong rights that a user can have or not

**Warning** plugins must be validated by the development team, a signature on each plugin guarantees the security and validation of the tool.
